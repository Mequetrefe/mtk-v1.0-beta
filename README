=== Mimetic Methods Toolkit (MTK) Version 1.0 README File ===
=============================================================

Version: Version 1.0 (Beta).

=== 1. Description ===
======================

Thank you for downloading the MTK. The Mimetic Methods Toolkit (MTK) is an
API that allows for an intuitive implementation of Mimetic Discretization
Methods for the resolution of Partial Differential Equations, yielding numerical
solutions that guarantee uniform order of accuracy all along the modeled
physical domain, while ensuring the satisfaction of conservation laws, thus
remaining faithful to the underlying physics of the problem. The library is
fully developed in C++, thus exploiting all the well-known advantages of both,
object-oriented application models and the extensive collection of data
structures capabilities of this language.

=== 2. Dependencies ===
=======================

This README assumes all of these libraries are installed in the following
folder:

$(HOME)/Libraries/

In this version, the MTK uses ATLAS-optimized BLAS routines for the internal
computation on some of the layers. However, ATLAS requires both BLAS and LAPACK
in order to create their optimized distributions. Therefore, the following
dependencies tree arises:

1. LAPACK - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
  1.1. BLAS - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/blas/

2. The GLPK - Available from: https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

3. (Optional) ATLAS - Available from: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
  2.1. BLAS - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/blas/
  2.2. LAPACK - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

4. (Optional) Doxygen - Available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ -
This is not an explicit dependence in order to build the MTK, but it is desired
in case the user wants to generate his/her own documentation (for development
purposes).

=== 3. Installation ===
=======================

PART 1. CONFIGURATION OF THE MAKEFILE.

The following steps are required the build and test the MTK. Please use the
provided ''makefile_inc'' file, which should provide a solid template to
start with. The following command provides help on the options for make:

$ make help
-----
Makefile for MTK version 1.0.

Options are:
- default: builds only the library and the examples.
- all: executes everything except the HELP and CLEAN options.
- mtklib: builds the library, i.e. generates the archive files.
- exmples: generates the examples.
- gendoc: generates the documentation for the library.
- checkheaders: checks syntax of the header files.

- clean: cleans ALL the generated files.
- cleanlib: cleans the generated archive and object files.
- cleanexamples: cleans the generated examples executables.
-----

PART 2. INSTALL THE LIBRARY.

$ make

If successful you'll read (before building the examples):

----- Library created! Check:
/home/ejspeiro/Dropbox/Public/mtk/mtk-v1.0/lib/libmtk.a

Examples will also be built.

=== 4. Frequently Asked Questions ===
=====================================

Q: Why haven't you guys implemented GBS to build the library?
A: I'm on it as we speak! ;)

Q: When will the other flavors be ready?
A: Soon! I'm working on getting help on developing those.

Q: Is there any main reference when it comes to the theory on Mimetic Disc.
Methods?
A: Yes! Check: http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/mtk/ and look for the bibliography
within the documentation for the API.

Q: Do I need to generate the documentation myself?
A: You can if you want to... but if you DO NOT want to, just go to our website.

=== 5. Contact and credits ===
==============================

MTK is a effort mainly carried on by researchers at the Computational Science
Research Center (CSRC) at San Diego State University (SDSU). Specifically, given
the diversity of application examples and also of theoretical contributors, the
development in both, applied and theoretical aspects are members of:

  1. Mimetic Methods Research and Development Group.
  2. Computational Geoscience Research and Development Group.
  3. Ocean Modeling Research and Development Group.

Currently the developers are:

  Jose E. Castillo, Ph.D. - castillo@myth.sdsu.edu
  Guillermo F. Miranda, Ph.D. - unigrav@hotmail.com
  Christopher P. Paolini, Ph.D. - paolini@engineering.sdsu.edu
